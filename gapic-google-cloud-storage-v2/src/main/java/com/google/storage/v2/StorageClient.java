/**
 * Service Description: ## API Overview and Naming Syntax
 *
 * <p>The GCS gRPC API allows applications to read and write data through the abstractions of
 * buckets and objects. For a description of these abstractions please see
 * https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs.
 *
 * <p>Resources are named as follows: - Projects are referred to as they are defined by the Resource
 * Manager API, using strings like `projects/123456` or `projects/my-string-id`. - Buckets are named
 * using string names of the form: `projects/{project}/buckets/{bucket}` For globally unique
 * buckets, `_` may be substituted for the project. - Objects are uniquely identified by their name
 * along with the name of the bucket they belong to, as separate strings in this API. For example:
 *
 * <p>ReadObjectRequest { bucket: 'projects/_/buckets/my-bucket' object: 'my-object' } Note that
 * object names can contain `/` characters, which are treated as any other character (no special
 * directory semantics).
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (StorageClient storageClient = StorageClient.create()) {
 *   StartResumableWriteRequest request =
 *       StartResumableWriteRequest.newBuilder()
 *           .setWriteObjectSpec(WriteObjectSpec.newBuilder().build())
 *           .setCommonObjectRequestParams(CommonObjectRequestParams.newBuilder().build())
 *           .setCommonRequestParams(CommonRequestParams.newBuilder().build())
 *           .build();
 *   StartResumableWriteResponse response = storageClient.startResumableWrite(request);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the StorageClient object to clean up resources such as
 * threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li>A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li>A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of StorageSettings to create().
 * For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * StorageSettings storageSettings =
 *     StorageSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * StorageClient storageClient = StorageClient.create(storageSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * StorageSettings storageSettings = StorageSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * StorageClient storageClient = StorageClient.create(storageSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.

  /**
   * Stores a new object and metadata.
   *
   * <p>An object can be written either in a single message stream or in a resumable sequence of
   * message streams. To write using a single stream, the client should include in the first message
   * of the stream an `WriteObjectSpec` describing the destination bucket, object, and any
   * preconditions. Additionally, the final message must set 'finish_write' to true, or else it is
   * an error.
   *
   * <p>For a resumable write, the client should instead call `StartResumableWrite()` and provide
   * that method an `WriteObjectSpec.` They should then attach the returned `upload_id` to the first
   * message of each following call to `Create`. If there is an error or the connection is broken
   * during the resumable `Create()`, the client should check the status of the `Create()` by
   * calling `QueryWriteStatus()` and continue writing from the returned `persisted_size`. This may
   * be less than the amount of data the client previously sent.
   *
   * <p>The service will not view the object as complete until the client has sent a
   * `WriteObjectRequest` with `finish_write` set to `true`. Sending any requests on a stream after
   * sending a request with `finish_write` set to `true` will cause an error. The client
   * &#42;&#42;should&#42;&#42; check the response it receives to determine how much data the
   * service was able to commit and whether the service views the object as complete.
   *
   * <p>Sample code:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * try (StorageClient storageClient = StorageClient.create()) {
