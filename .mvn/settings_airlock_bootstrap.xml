      This settings.xml file helps to download the artifactregistry-maven-wagon extension in local
      Maven repository with repository ID "mirror-of-all", which is the same as the repository
      ID in settings_airlock.xml. Because this correspondence, Maven will not try to download
      the artifactregistry-maven-wagon from Airlock when this artifact and its dependencies are
      available in the local Maven repository.
