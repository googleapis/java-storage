/**
 * Buffering {@link java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel} which attempts to maximize the amount of
 * bytes written to the underlying {@link UnbufferedWritableByteChannel} while minimizing
 * unnecessary copying of said bytes.
 *
 * <p>Our flushing strategy is "eager", meaning as soon as we have enough bytes greater than or
 * equal to the capacity of our buffer we will write all bytes to the underlying channel.
 *
 * <p>A few strategies are employed to meet the stated goals.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>If we do not have any bytes in our buffer and {@code src} is the same size as our buffer,
 *       simply {@link UnbufferedWritableByteChannel#write(ByteBuffer) write(src)} to the the
 *       underlying channel
 *   <li>If we do not have any bytes in our buffer and {@code src} is smaller than the size of our
 *       buffer, enqueue it in full
 *   <li>If we do have enqueued bytes and {@code src} is the size of our remaining buffer space
 *       {@link UnbufferedWritableByteChannel#write(ByteBuffer[]) write([buffer, src])} to the
 *       underlying channel
 *   <li>If we do have enqueued bytes and {@code src} is larger than the size of our remaining
 *       buffer space, take a slice of {@code src} the same size as the remaining space in our
 *       buffer and {@link UnbufferedWritableByteChannel#write(ByteBuffer[]) write([buffer, slice])}
 *       to the underlying channel before enqueuing any outstanding bytes which are smaller than our
 *       buffer.
 *   <li>If we do have enqueued bytes and {@code src} is smaller than our remaining buffer space,
 *       enqueue it in full
 * </ol>
