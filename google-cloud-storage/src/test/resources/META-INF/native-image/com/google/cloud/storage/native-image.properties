# The JUnitFeature which is brought in by Graal explicitly initializes
# Parameterized at image build time. This causes ParallelParameterized and
# subsequently com.google.cloud.storage.conformance.retry.ITRetryConformanceTest
# and other classes ITRetryConformanceTest references to also be initialized at
# build time. Initializing these classes explicitly at build time results in a
# successful build.
